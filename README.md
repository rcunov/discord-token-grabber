# discord-token-grabber
This branch contains some modifications to the main branch that add data exfiltration for the tokens. I wanted to build this out to challenge myself but since I intended for the primary purpose of the project to be a clear explanation of how Discord tokens work, I didn't want to confuse people with unnecessary complexity.
